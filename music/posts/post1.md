# Welcome to My Music Blog

<div style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Led Zeppelin Cover" src="images/thinker.jpg" width="500"/> </div>

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This is where I share songs that have left an impression on me. Music plays
a significant role in my life, and this blog is my way of documenting and expressing my personal musical journey.

A quick note: I’m not a musician, nor do I claim to understand music theory. This blog is purely for fun and
self-expression. Since I only plan to post tracks or albums that I genuinely enjoy, you won’t find reviews with scores
here—I’d rather leave ratings out than skew the scale with only 8s and 9s.

If you’ve stumbled upon this blog, I hope it helps you discover some absolute bangers. Happy listening!
